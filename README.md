# Wumpbot

A Discord bot template creator allows to create Discord bot
automatically by its CLI (command) without a hassle of setting up the repository or installing packages manually.

It has configurations like ESLint, Prettier, Git and many more.

**NOTE**: This is an experimental package so bugs may occur.

# Installation

```
npm install -g wumpbot
```

# Documentation

To create a Discord bot with this package, type:
`wumpbot --init` or `npx wumpbot --init` on your shell command

Follow the instructions carefully and wait for a while to do
some hardwork for you. Open your preferred code editor and do some stuff with it. It supports both TypeScript and JavaScript.
