# Wumpbot

A Discord.js template project creator allows to create Discord.js project
automatically by its CLI (command) without a hassle of setting up the repository or installing packages manually.

It has configurations like ESLint, Prettier, Git and many more.

**NOTE**: This is an experimental package so bugs may occur.

# Installation

```
npm install -g wumpbot
```

# Documentation

To create a Discord bot with this package, type:
`wumpbot create` or `npx wumpbot create` on your shell command

Follow the instructions carefully and wait for a while to do
some hardwork for you. Open your preferred code editor and do some stuff with it. It supports both TypeScript and JavaScript.

# Testing

Clone the entire repository and place to your desired folder.
Type either `npm ci` or `npm install` (it depends on you, if you prefer one of them)

Run this command here: `npm run devlink`.

It ensures that the entire project is built and ready for testing.

To test the CLI, type:
`wumpbot-dev`
